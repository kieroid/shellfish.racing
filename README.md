i made a weird terminal-like thing that i think looks a little silly. i will use this to my advantage.
this website and the code sucks if you look close enough. except for the thing with the dictionary
and the functions in the dictionary. that is pretty cool i think.

idk why you are here. go do something interesting like not look at this code.
